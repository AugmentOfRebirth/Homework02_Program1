HW02 for cis183



This program allows you to change the background through seekbars (sliders)

There are three seekbars, one for Red, Green, and Blue, each of them with 

values that go from 0 to 255. When the background becomes too dark

the text on the background will change to white. You can save the current

color to a listview and you will be able to select previously saved colors.

Hexadecimal value is also shown.
